Deadlines for each grant cycle can be found here. Projects aligning with one of our four Funding Focus Areas can be considered in any grant cycle.\\nWhile the Butterfield Foundation provides funding throughout the world, Oklahoma is a funding priority for all our Funding Focus Areas, accounting for at least 50% of our charitable giving.\\nPrior to applying for a grant, we encourage you to visit our ‘About’ page and ‘Eligibility’ section below, which detail the Foundation’s mission, history, and grantmaking priorities as part of our commitment to whole person care.\\nThe Foundation’s grant process begins with a Letter of Inquiry. From here, you will be redirected to the Foundation’s grant application platform to start the application process. If you do not have an account, you will be prompted to create one at that time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStarting The Grant Process\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nCheck Eligibility \\n\\nOn this page, visit the eligibility section and verify your organizations eligibility for Butterfield Foundation grant.\\n\\nCheck Eligibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nSetup a Grant Account\\n\\nThe grant application process is managed entirely through your own account on the Butterfield Foundation Grant Portal.\\n\\nSetup Account\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nSubmit Letter of Inquiry\\n\\nUsing your newly established, Butterfield Foundation, portal account, submit a new Letter of Inquiry to get the process started.\\n\\nSign In\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding Focus Areas\\nButterfield Foundation has four (4) Funding Focus Areas that define our granting priorities.

Please review our eligibility requirements before applying for funding.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCharitable Whole Person Healthcare\\nBMF seeks to meet the whole person healthcare needs of underserved individuals by partnering with nonprofit Christian organizations serving their community with priority given to Oklahoma. Projects funded should improve the quality of care offered to each patient, address health issues impacting a large portion of the population, and advance the efforts of charitable care by educating providers. Examples of funding include: construction, renovations, medical equipment, lab equipment, dental equipment, vision equipment, strategic planning, technology upgrades, and training for staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChoose Life Advancement\\nBMF seeks to partner with nonprofit Christian organizations serving individuals with unintended pregnancies, those in need of post-abortive healing, and those healing from or vulnerable to sex-trafficking. Projects funded should expand outreach, provide training opportunities that enhance client care, or improve service delivery. Examples of funding include: ultrasound machines, building improvements, equipment, technology upgrades, website updates, pregnancy/parenting curriculum, center signage, and training for staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational Whole Person Healthcare\\nBMF seeks to collaborate with nonprofit Christian organizations serving an international population meeting whole person healthcare needs. Projects funded should increase the number of individuals served, improve health conditions, or create programs for indigenous people to mitigate community health needs. Examples of funding include: construction, renovations, imaging equipment, lab equipment, dental equipment, vision equipment, surgical equipment, strategic planning, water/sanitation, community health training, solar power, technology upgrades, and training for staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpiritual Care Advancement\\nBMF seeks to collaborate with nonprofit Christian healthcare organizations to advance spiritual care as a core component of whole person care. Projects funded should create training opportunities to advance understanding and knowledge of spiritual care and improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of individuals. Examples of funding include: curriculum development, spiritual care/chaplaincy trainings, spiritual care internships, and trauma-informed care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrant Eligibility\\nIt is important to review eligibility requirements and funding priorities before starting your application.\\nThe following criteria is standard across our funding program:\\n\\nWithin the United States, funding is limited to organizations recognized by the IRS as a U.S. 501(c)(3) public charity.\\nA non-U.S. grantee must work with a U.S. 501(c)(3) to act as a fiscal agent, an organization that agrees to accept and be responsible for grant funds on your behalf.\\nAll organizations must have a Christian purpose stated in their founding documents i.e. bylaws, mission statement, and/or vision statement.\\nButterfield Foundation does not award grants to individuals, ongoing program expenses, operating expenses (includes salaries), endowments, or sponsorships.\\nGrants can be requested through our online application process only.\\n\\nIn selecting projects for consideration, the Foundation evaluates alignment with our funding priorities and our values and considers whether we can make a meaningful difference with our impact and our investments.\\nOrganizations that have previously received funding from the Foundation may submit a new Letter of Inquiry after 12 months has passed since the approval of the previous funding, expenditure of all awarded funds, and reporting requirements have been completed.\\nButterfield Foundation will consider funding multi-year projects on a case-by-case basis but, in general, this is not the Foundation’s primary form of funding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrant Cycle Deadlines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDecember 1, 2024\\n\\nDecember 1, 2024\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 1\\n\\nLetters of Inquiry OPEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJanuary 31, 2025\\n\\nJanuary 31, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 1\\n\\nLetters of Inquiry DUE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarch 5, 2025\\n\\nMarch 5, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 1\\n\\nGrant Applications DUE\\nFunding Decisions Made in Early May\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarch 31, 2025\\n\\nMarch 31, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 2\\n\\nLetters of Inquiry OPEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApril 30, 2025\\n\\nApril 30, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 2\\n\\nLetters of Inquiry DUE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJune 1, 2025\\n\\nJune 1, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 2\\n\\nGrant Applications DUE\\nFunding Decisions Made in July\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 15, 2025\\n\\nJuly 15, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 3\\n\\nLetters of Inquiry OPEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 15, 2025\\n\\nAugust 15, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 3\\n\\nLetters of Inquiry DUE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2025\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2025\\n\\n2025 Grant Cycle 3\\n\\nGrant Applications DUE\\nFunding Decisions Made in November\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nK\\nL\\nWhat is the mission of the Foundation?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe manifest the redeeming love of Christ by focusing on the physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being of people, consistent with the tenets of the Free Methodist Church USA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nK\\nL\\nWhen was Butterfield Foundation formed?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeaconess Hospital was founded on North Portland Avenue in Oklahoma City in the early part of the last century.
