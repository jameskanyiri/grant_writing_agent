Projects aligning with one of our four [Funding Focus Areas](https://butterfieldfoundation.org/grant-gateway/#fundingFocusAreas) can be considered in any grant cycle.\\\\n\\\\nFunding Focus Areas\\\\n\\\\nButterfield Foundation has four (4) Funding Focus Areas that define our granting priorities.\\\\n\\\\n* Charitable Whole Person Healthcare:\\\\n  + BMF seeks to meet the whole person healthcare needs of underserved individuals by partnering with nonprofit Christian organizations serving their community with priority given to Oklahoma. Projects funded should improve the quality of care offered to each patient, address health issues impacting a large portion of the population, and advance the efforts of charitable care by educating providers.\\\\n  + Examples of funding include: construction, renovations, medical equipment, lab equipment, dental equipment, vision equipment, strategic planning, technology upgrades, and training for staff.\\\\n* Choose Life Advancement:\\\\n  + BMF seeks to partner with nonprofit Christian organizations serving individuals with unintended pregnancies, those in need of post-abortive healing, and those healing from or vulnerable to sex-trafficking. Projects funded should expand outreach, provide training opportunities that enhance client care, or improve service delivery.\\\\n  + Examples of funding include: ultrasound machines, building improvements, equipment, technology upgrades, website updates, pregnancy/parenting curriculum, center signage, and training for staff.\\\\n* International Whole Person Healthcare:\\\\n  + BMF seeks to collaborate with nonprofit Christian organizations serving an international population meeting whole person healthcare needs. Projects funded should increase the number of individuals served, improve health conditions, or create programs for indigenous people to mitigate community health needs.\\\\n  + Examples of funding include: construction, renovations, imaging equipment, lab equipment, dental equipment, vision equipment, surgical equipment, strategic planning, water/sanitation, community health training, solar power, technology upgrades, and training for staff.\\\\n* Spiritual Care Advancement:\\\\n  + BMF seeks to collaborate with nonprofit Christian healthcare organizations to advance spiritual care as a core component of whole person care. Projects funded should create training opportunities to advance understanding and knowledge of spiritual care and improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of individuals.\\\\n  + Examples of funding include: curriculum development, spiritual care/chaplaincy trainings, spiritual care internships, and trauma-informed care.\\\\n\\\\nIn selecting projects for consideration, the Foundation evaluates alignment with our funding priorities and our values and considers whether we can make a meaningful difference with our impact and our investments.\\\\n\\\\n**Butterfield Grant Gateway**\\\\n\\\\nDiscover opportunities to make a difference through our diverse grant programs.
